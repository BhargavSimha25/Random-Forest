# Random Forest in Machine Learning 🌳

Welcome to the **Random Forest in Machine Learning** repository! This project is dedicated to exploring the Random Forest algorithm, a robust and versatile ensemble learning method that is widely used for classification and regression tasks. This repository provides an in-depth look into how Random Forest works, its applications, and practical examples to help you implement it effectively.

## 📚 Overview

Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique that builds multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes for classification or the average prediction for regression. It is known for its high accuracy, ability to handle large datasets, and robustness against overfitting.
